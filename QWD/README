Quantum Walk Data Version 1.0 2015-08-25


What is it?
-----------

Quantum Walk Data is a program coded in Java
that use Apache Hadoop to generate the data to be used in a
specific Quantum Walk simulation with four walkers
in a one-dimensional lattice.


Apache Hadoop and Java Version notes
------------------------------------

The Quantum Walk supports JDK 1.6 or
higher and Apache Hadoop version 1.2 or higher.
Note that we have currently tested this
implementation with JDK 1.7 and Apache Hadoop
1.2.1.


Parameters
----------

In the QW.java file the user can change the
value of the variable SIZE, STEPS, PATH, JAR_DIR
and CLEAN_FOLDERS.

-SIZE: The dimensions of the two dimensional
    lattice.

-WORK_DIR: The path in the HDFS where the program
	will store the data. 

-JAR_DIR: The folder path where the .jar files
	are stored.
	
-OUTPUT_DIR: The folder path where the result
	will be stored. Should be a empty folder
	because this ALL DATA will be deleted.
	
-CLEAN_FOLDERS: Set for true to delete
    unnecessary files during the execution to
    increase available storage space.


Compile and run
---------------

To compile the code you need to set the
environment variable CLASSPATH for your user with:

HADOOP_FOLDER_PATH/*:HADOOP_FOLDER_PATH/lib/*


Open the Terminal and go to the location where
the folder src is stored. Now, execute the follow
commands:

mkdir bin
javac -d bin/ src/QWD.java
jar -cvf qwd.jar -C bin/ .

To run execute the follow command:

hadoop jar qwd.jar qwd.QWD
