Grover Simulator Version 1.1 2015-06-07


What is it?
-----------

Grover Simulator is a program coded in Java that
use Apache Hadoop to execute a Grover simulation.


Apache Hadoop and Java Version notes
------------------------------------

The Grover Simulator supports JDK 1.6 or higher
and Apache Hadoop version 1.2 or higher. Note that we
have currently tested this implementation with
JDK 1.7 and Apache Hadoop 1.2.1.


Parameters
----------

In the Grover.java file the user can change the
value of the variable COUNT_PSI.

-COUNT_PSI: This value should be the maximum
	number of parallel executions
	configurated in	Apache Hadoop. Contact
	the cluster administrator for that
	information.

In the GS.java file the user can change the value
of the variables n, PATH and JAR_DIR.

-N: This is the size of the list where the Grover
	algorithm will do the search.

-PATH: The path in the HDFS where the program
	will store the data. 

-JAR_DIR: The folder path where the .jar files
	are stored.

-OUTPUT_DIR: The folder path where the result
	will be stored. 


Compile and run
---------------

To compile the code you need to set the
environment variable CLASSPATH for your user with:

HADOOP_FOLDER_PATH/*:HADOOP_FOLDER_PATH/lib/*


Open the Terminal and go to the location where
the folder src is stored. Now, execute
the follow commands:

mkdir bin
mkdir bin/grover_class
javac -d bin/grover_class/ src/Grover.java
jar -cvf grover.jar -C bin/grover_class/ .
mkdir bin/gs_class
javac -d bin/gs_class/ src/GS.java
jar -cvf gs.jar -C bin/gs_class/ .


To run execute the follow command:

hadoop jar gs.jar gs.GS
