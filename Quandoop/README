lines with the data. The format is:

-Header:
#TYPE,M,N

        -TYPE: A or B. A is the left matrix. B is
               the right matrix.
        -M and N: The dimensions of the matrices.
                  A vector must have a column
                  matrix format: #TYPE,M,1

-Other lines:
TYPE,M,N,REALjIMAGINARY
    where:
        -TYPE: A or B. A is the left matrix. B is
               the right matString absSquare;
        String reshape;
        String pdf;rix.
        -M and N: The row and column value. A
                  vector must have a column

        -REAL and IMAGINARY: The real and the
                             imaginary value for
                             each element of the
